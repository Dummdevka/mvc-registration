<h1>Man has underpants stolen from alligator</h1>

<p>Today, a Florida man was taken by surprise when an alligator attacked. He was at a nearby lake with his family enjoying the weather when the incident occurred.</p>

<p>"I was just drinking my beer and reached for a stick near the water - that's when she got me!" said Clint Jameson, 31 of Maripoca.</p>

<p>After being taken to the hospital, it was discovered that he hadn't suffered any actual wounds in the attack. He simply wasn't wearing pants any longer, but was too intoxicated to know the difference.</p>

<p>"Hey, I'm real sorry about all this. An alligator stole my pants so I thought 'MY LEGS DON'T LOOK RIGHT NO MORE!' and panicked."</p>

<p>No arrests have been made, but the alligator is said to still be at large. Police urge all nearby residents to call the police immediately if they see an alligator wearing pants.</p>
